## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

-Make a list of your favorite 3-5 applications and identify 2-3 features that
 make them your favorite app. Its okay if features repeat on different apps
    Example App: Instagram
    Changing the background color of the messages screen
    Deleting old messages
    
    Favorite Application:
        1- 30 day Fitness            
               - Libery of workouts, which slowly progress over 30 days
               - Each workout includes your sets/reps and warm up 
               - once you start, it starts a timer
        2- Reddit
               - View How many people are online
               - You can upvote and Downvote posts
        3- Notes
               - You can share a note with a people and both make edits 
               - You can lock a note, and make it require a passcode
        4- Notion
               - Create your own template
               - insert differene types of text and changes the format depending  on what it is.
        5- Instagram
               - View others stories
               - Feed of friends and following 

-Think of an app idea that you would like to build. It can be a new idea or an improvement on an existing app. Write a short paragraph describing the app and the features you would like to implement. You are not commiting to this idea, but it helps to start brain storming early on and get feedback from your peers and instructors.

        - One app idea that I brainstormed revolves around transforming eco-friendliness 
        into an engaging and rewarding game. Picture this: an app where users earn rewards 
        and recognition for making environmentally responsible choices, turning sustainability 
        into an exciting challenge. This app would also include a leaderboard, allowing users to 
        compete with friends and others to see who can top the charts in their eco-friendly endeavors. 
        Plus, it would plot their progress over time and use the camera to provide real-time feedback 
        on how to reduce their carbon footprint. Users could scan items like food, bikes, or any 
        products to instantly see how environmentally friendly they are
    
## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

        - I had isssues connecting the button along with its 
        logic to make it actually work and change the color of 
        the screen. Also I had issues with setting up github and git.
